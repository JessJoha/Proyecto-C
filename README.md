# Basic Calculator

This is a simple C++ project that functions as a basic calculator. It allows the user to input two numbers and an operator, and it performs the corresponding operation (+, -, *, /).

## Technologies Needed

- C++ Compiler (g++)
- Docker (to run the project in a containerized environment)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, for better C++ development experience)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JessJoha/ProjectC++.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ProjectC++
    ```

3. Ensure g++ is installed by checking the version with the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ --version
    ```

    If you don't have g++ installed, you can install it using your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `brew`, `yum`).

## Running the Project

To run the project, compile and execute the code with the following commands:

1. Compile the C++ file:

    ```bash
    g++ -o c++project c++project.cpp
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./c++project
    ```

The program will prompt you to input two numbers and an operator, then display the result.
